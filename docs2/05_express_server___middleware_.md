# Chapter 5: Express Server & Middleware

In [Chapter 4: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Pipeline (Shell)](04_server_side_rendering__ssr__pipeline__shell__.md), we learned how the `shell` application's server generates the initial HTML for a page *before* sending it to the browser. This makes the site feel faster and helps search engines.

But how does the server actually *know* what to do when a browser request comes in? How does it handle different tasks like logging visits, checking security, or serving files like images and CSS? This is where **Express.js** and the concept of **Middleware** come into play.

## What Problem Does This Solve? The Server's Front Desk

Imagine our web server is like a large office building. When someone (a browser request) arrives at the entrance, they don't just wander straight into any office (the Server-Side Rendering logic). They need to go through a process:

1.  **Reception:** Someone needs to greet the visitor (receive the request).
2.  **Security Check:** Maybe check their ID or purpose (apply security rules like rate limiting).
3.  **Information Desk:** Perhaps give them a map or directions (serve static files like CSS or JavaScript if requested).
4.  **Routing:** Finally, direct them to the correct office or floor (pass the request to the right handler, like our SSR engine).

Without a system, this would be chaos! **Express.js** is like the framework or blueprint for setting up this reception area and its processes. **Middleware** functions are like the individual staff members (receptionist, security guard, information desk attendant) who perform specific tasks on each incoming visitor (request) before they reach their final destination.

In `cohbrgr`, the `shell` application uses an Express server as its backend foundation. Middleware functions handle all the necessary "front desk" tasks before the request is handed off to generate the page using Server-Side Rendering.

## Key Concepts: Express and Middleware

Let's break down these two core ideas:

1.  **Express.js (The Framework):**
    *   Express is a popular, minimal, and flexible web application framework for Node.js (the JavaScript environment our server runs in).
    *   It provides a simple way to:
        *   Start a web server that listens for requests on a specific port (like port 3000).
        *   Handle different types of web requests (like GET requests for fetching pages).
        *   Manage the "request-response cycle" â€“ receiving a request, processing it, and sending back a response.
        *   Organize server logic using routing and middleware.
    *   Think of it as providing the basic structure and tools for building the reception area.

2.  **Middleware (The Checkpoints):**
    *   Middleware functions are the heart of how Express processes requests.
    *   They are functions that have access to the incoming request (`req`), the outgoing response (`res`), and a special function called `next`.
    *   Each middleware function performs a specific task: logging, checking headers, compressing data, serving a file, etc.
    *   Crucially, after a middleware function finishes its task, it usually calls `next()` to pass control to the *next* middleware function in the chain. If it doesn't call `next()`, the request processing stops (e.g., if it sends a response directly, like an error message).
    *   Think of middleware as a pipeline or an assembly line. Each request goes through various stations (middleware functions) for processing.

## How `cohbrgr` Uses Express & Middleware

Let's look at the `shell` server's main setup file to see how Express and middleware are used.

**1. Setting up the Express App:**

We start by importing Express and creating an application instance.

```typescript
// Simplified from apps/shell/src/server/index.ts
import express from 'express';
// ... other imports ...

const app = express(); // Create the Express application

// ... middleware setup happens here ...

// Start the server listening on a port
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```
*   `express()` creates our main application object, usually called `app`.
*   `app.listen()` starts the server, making it ready to accept incoming requests on the specified port (3000 in this case).

**2. Adding Middleware with `app.use()`:**

The `app.use()` method is how we tell Express to add a middleware function to the processing pipeline. The order in which we use `app.use()` matters, as requests flow through them sequentially.

Here are some examples from `cohbrgr`:

```typescript
// Simplified from apps/shell/src/server/index.ts
import compression from 'compression';
import nocache from 'nocache';
import { logging, methodDetermination } from '@cohbrgr/server';
// ...

// Disable browser caching
app.use(nocache());

// Log incoming requests (custom middleware)
app.use(logging(isProduction));

// Check if the request method is allowed (GET/HEAD)
app.use(methodDetermination);

// Compress responses for faster delivery
app.use(compression());

// Serve static files (CSS, JS, images) from the 'dist/client' folder
app.use(express.static(staticPath));

// Generate a security token (nonce) for this request
app.use((_req, res, next) => {
    res.locals['cspNonce'] = generateNonce(); // Simplified
    next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
});

// Finally, use the SSR middleware (from Chapter 4)
app.use(serverRender);
```

*   **`nocache()`**: Prevents the browser from caching responses.
*   **`logging(...)`**: Our custom middleware (from `packages/server`) to log details about the request. We pass `isProduction` to potentially change logging behavior.
*   **`methodDetermination`**: Another custom middleware that checks if the request uses an allowed HTTP method (like GET). If not, it sends an error response and stops processing.
*   **`compression()`**: Compresses response bodies (like HTML, CSS, JS) using gzip, making them smaller and faster to download.
*   **`express.static(staticPath)`**: If the request asks for a file (e.g., `/main.css`), this middleware checks if a file with that name exists in the `staticPath` directory (`dist/client`). If found, it sends the file back directly and stops further processing for that request.
*   **Nonce Generation**: A simple inline middleware function. It generates a random security token (`nonce`), attaches it to the response object (`res.locals`), and then calls `next()` to continue processing. This nonce is used later in the [SSR Pipeline](04_server_side_rendering__ssr__pipeline__shell__.md) for Content Security Policy.
*   **`serverRender`**: This is the SSR middleware we discussed in [Chapter 4](04_server_side_rendering__ssr__pipeline__shell__.md). It's typically placed last or near the end because it handles generating the main HTML page response *if* the request hasn't already been handled by earlier middleware (like `express.static`).

**3. A Peek at a Simple Middleware Function:**

Let's look at the `logging` middleware.

```typescript
// Simplified from packages/server/src/middleware/logging.ts
import { Logger } from '@cohbrgr/utils';
import { NextFunction, Request, Response } from 'express';

export const logging =
    (isProduction: boolean) => // Outer function receives config
    (req: Request, _res: Response, next: NextFunction) => { // The actual middleware
        const message = `Requesting: ${req.url}`;
        Logger.info(message); // Log the request URL

        next(); // IMPORTANT: Pass control to the next middleware!
    };
```
*   It takes the request (`req`), response (`res`), and `next` function as arguments.
*   It performs its task: logging the requested URL using our `Logger` utility.
*   It calls `next()` to signal that Express should move on to the next middleware in the chain.

## Internal Implementation: The Request Flow

Let's trace a typical request for the homepage (`/`) step-by-step through the middleware pipeline:

1.  **Request Arrives:** Your browser sends a `GET /` request to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Express Receives:** The Express server running receives the request.
3.  **`nocache()`:** This middleware adds headers to the response to prevent caching. Calls `next()`.
4.  **`logging()`:** Logs "Requesting: /" to the console. Calls `next()`.
5.  **`methodDetermination()`:** Checks the method (`GET`). It's allowed. Calls `next()`.
6.  **`compression()`:** Sets up response compression. Calls `next()`.
7.  **`express.static()`:** Looks for a file named `/` in the static directory. Doesn't find one (it's not a direct file request). Calls `next()`.
8.  **Nonce Generation:** Creates a random nonce (e.g., `abc123xyz`) and stores it in `res.locals.cspNonce`. Calls `next()`.
9.  **`serverRender()`:** This is the SSR middleware. It takes over, uses the nonce, renders the React app for the `/` route (potentially fetching content from the `content` app via server-side [Module Federation](02_module_federation__via_rspack__.md)), and sends the final HTML response back to the browser. Since this middleware sends the response, it *doesn't* call `next()`.
10. **Done:** The request-response cycle is complete.

Here's a simplified diagram of this flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser
    participant ExpressApp as Express Server
    participant LoggingMW as Logging Middleware
    participant StaticMW as Static Files Middleware
    participant NonceMW as Nonce Middleware
    participant SsrMW as SSR Middleware

    Browser->>ExpressApp: GET /
    ExpressApp->>LoggingMW: Process Request
    LoggingMW->>ExpressApp: next()
    ExpressApp->>StaticMW: Process Request (No file found)
    StaticMW->>ExpressApp: next()
    ExpressApp->>NonceMW: Process Request (Generate Nonce)
    NonceMW->>ExpressApp: next()
    ExpressApp->>SsrMW: Process Request (Render HTML)
    SsrMW-->>Browser: Send HTML Response
```

If the request was for `/main.css`:
- The `express.static()` middleware *would* find the file.
- It would send the `main.css` content back to the browser.
- It would *not* call `next()`. The request processing would stop there, and the `serverRender` middleware would never run for that request.

## Conclusion

You've learned how the `cohbrgr` backend uses **Express.js** as its foundation and **Middleware** functions as checkpoints in a pipeline to process incoming requests.

Key takeaways:
*   **Express** provides the structure for our Node.js web server.
*   **Middleware** functions handle specific tasks like logging, security, compression, and serving static files.
*   `app.use()` adds middleware to the processing chain in a specific order.
*   Middleware functions use `req` (request), `res` (response), and `next()` to perform tasks and pass control along the chain.
*   This organized approach allows us to build complex server logic by composing smaller, reusable pieces of middleware, eventually leading to handlers like our [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Pipeline (Shell)](04_server_side_rendering__ssr__pipeline__shell__.md).

But how does all this code (both client and server) get bundled, optimized, and prepared for deployment? That's the job of our build system, powered by Rspack.
